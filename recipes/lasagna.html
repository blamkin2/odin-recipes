        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>noodles</li>
            <li>mozzerella cheese</li>
            <li>ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>large egg</li>
            <li>italian seasoning</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>pepper</li>
            <li>tomato sauce</li>
            <li>beef</li>
            <li>sausage</li>
            <li>onion</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil over medium heat and add the diced onions. Let them soften for 10 minutes. (This allows them to release a little sugar which is a nice offset to the acidity of the tomatoes.)</li>
            <li>Add the ground beef and sausage and increase heat to medium-high. Use a spatula to break up the meat so that it’s very fine and crumbled. Cook for 8-10 minutes, or until cooked through. Add garlic during the last minute. Drain excess grease.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken broth and use a silicone spatula to “clean” the bottom and sides of the pot. Add the marinara sauce, tomato paste, hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cover partially and let the sauce simmer gently.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375°.</li>
            <li>Begin boiling a large pot of salted pasta water for the lasagna noodles. Once a rapid boil is reached, cook the noodles to al dente according to package instructions. (Set a timer to ensure you don’t overcook them.) Gently stir with a wooden spoon throughout cooking to prevent the noodles from sticking. Drain and rinse with cold water until noodles are completely cool.</li>
            <li>Lay the cooled noodles flat on wax or parchment paper while you begin assembling the lasagna.</li>
            <li>Spread 1 heaping cup of meat sauce on the bottom of a 9 x 13-inch casserole dish. Next, add 4 lasagna noodles, overlapping them if needed.</li>
            <li>Spread 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by about 1 ½ cups of meat sauce.</li>
            <li>Top with 4 more lasagna noodles, 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture, 1 ½ cups meat sauce. Finish with 4 more lasagna noodles, the rest of the ricotta mixture, and the rest of the meat sauce.</li>
            <li>Top with 2 ½ cups of Mozzarella cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake for 30 minutes. Remove cover and bake for 15 more minutes. If desired, broil at 450° to brown the top more, watch it carefully during this time.</li>
        </ol>
